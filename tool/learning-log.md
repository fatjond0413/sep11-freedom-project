### 10/23/24:
#### What I first did
* Went the the kaboom (website)[https://kaboomjs.com/]
* scrolled around for abit at the website and read a bit
* looked at the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add)
* Wondered how I was going to code this then I realized I could just copy and paste the code and watch the tutorials
  #### Testing out the products of the tool
  * I went to the play ground and played some games to get an idea of what it is capable of
  * I played a rpg game, a flappy bird game, and also a jumping platform game

### 10/24/2024:
#### Researching my tool
* I watched this [kaboom video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRXI6ThRJvM&list=PLNwtXgWIx3rgk68WwrykC7BIJ50kT6ZpS)
* Asked myself how I was going to make a pixel based gamed?
* Looked at more videos and read a bit of the [tutorial](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup)

### Project: 2d platformer

#### Tinkeering with my tool and exploring parts of the play ground. Date 10/28
* I went to the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) and started adding some sprites
* I added some sprites like ghost and realized you needed this code `loadSprite("bean", "/sprites/bean.png")` to be able to add a sprite.
* I then went to the [movement](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=movement) part of the playground and changed the movement keys from arrows to WDSA keys.
* I also deleted some lines like `onKeyDown("up", () => {player.move(0, -SPEED) })` and the character stoped moving down so these must be a movement control.
#### Examining the RPG part of the playground
* I went to the [RPG](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=rpg) section of the playground and there I examined everything first
* I changed the dialoge to "EEEEEE"
* Wondered how I can get the character to hold a weapon?
*  I was confused by this when I first saw it, but then I realized that It is the map.
