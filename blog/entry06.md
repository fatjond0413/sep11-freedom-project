## Just finish my SEP 11 expo

 After finshing my SEP 11 expo I can say that my elavator pitch need some work, for most of my presentation I commenly went past the one miniute mark and went on talking about freedom project for about 3 miniutes instead, and that does not include answering the questions asked by the judges. This has lead to me going way to long as wasting time from the judges and made me realize that I need to improve on my elevator pitch or else I will not be able to present once I leave school or do not have more then one miniute. How I am going to improve is by doing 3 things. one is by continuing to record myself presenting my freedom project elevator pitch and seeing how long it is and trying to shorten it. my second way is by watching videos at youtube about elevator pitches and how to improve them so I have a better idea on how to shorten them. Why I plan to do this si so that wen I have to do an elevator pitch, it will not take the time of 5 elevator pitches instead.
