## Just finish my SEP 11 expo

 After finshing my SEP 11 expo I can say that my elavator pitch need some work, for most of my presentation I commenly went past the one miniute mark and went on talking about freedom project for about 3 miniutes instead, and that does not include answering the questions asked by the judges. This has lead to me going way to long as wasting time from the judges and made me realize that I need to improve on my elevator pitch or else I will not be able to present once I leave school or do not have more then one miniute. How I am going to improve is by doing 3 things. one is by continuing to record myself presenting my freedom project elevator pitch and seeing how long it is and trying to shorten it. my second way is by watching videos at youtube about elevator pitches and how to improve them so I have a better idea on how to shorten them. Why I plan to do this si so that wen I have to do an elevator pitch, it will not take the time of 5 elevator pitches instead.

 ## My freedom project presentation
   Shortly after my SEP 11 expo I was up for presentation, on my presentation, I did alright, I just failed to present well and got a 7.5/10 my presentation. I thought I did well but I was wrong. I read the eamil and decided that I should start practicing more so that next time I get a 100 next time. How I plan to do this is by  doing the same thing for the explo and recorded my self and watch youtube videos.
   ## EDP stage

Communicating the results of my freedom product as I have not only finished it on may, but am past explaning it to the judges and the classroom as I did that 3 weeks ago .Since I made the product and presented it, I am done with my product and communicating the results to you reading, i am on stage 8.
