  ## Learning about my tool
   After a couple of months of working with kaboom and completeing my freedom project on Kaboom.js(A very bad move I know I will talk about later) I had finished finished my 
  MVP,(Before I lost the code). I felt kinda of proud with my code as I was juts finishing my second level which is a platformer level that works similar to the skyworld level in Mario games. Below is a small sample of my level 2.
````js
        loadSprite("grass", "/sprites/grass.png")

        const leve2l = addlevel([
	"        =  =   ^ ^  =        ==^==           ^   ",
	"=  =  =      = = ^   =    =              ="        ,
   "                 ==        =            =          =",
], {
	tileWidth: 86,
	tileHeight: 124,
      
 ````
This really made me feel like I have strong understanding of [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/), what specific lines do like `loadSprite()` 'addLevel`, how to install it into my IDE(THis took me three months to do when I first started, it was a nightmare for me). THis project gave me a well developed, I could learn more about [kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/).

## My progress towards my MVP

   Ah yes, my [MVP](https://github.com/fatjond0413/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/index.html), I had completed it, however I decided to do something very stupid, this stupid thing had lead me to lossing my entire code, my entire MVP. THe mistake was that instead of puting my MVP code into [Kaboom playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add), why I did this is because I thought it was easier to do it in the playground then [cs50 or my IDE](https://cs50.dev/). This mistake had lead me to loosing all my progress in my MVP, snd go all the way back to square one. Bu I do have an stong idea on what the code is so I should be good.
 
## Engineering Design Process and skills.
     For my Engineering Design Process I belive I am at 4(Create a plan) becuase I do not have a prodotype as I lost it. But I do have a very promising plan on how to do it as I have done it before. I would say that it would take me about 5 days from this to complete my MVP on my IDE. FOr skills I have learned how to better embrace failure, instead of just giving up, even though I have considered, I decided to redo it and be more careful next time so I do not go through this again. I also learned that I need to be more organized and better place my files, mainly by puting them in safe place like my IDE or places where they will not otomaticly delete.
