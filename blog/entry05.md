  ## Learning about my tool
   After a couple of months of working with kaboom and completeing my freedom project on Kaboom.js(A very bad move I know I will talk about later) I had finished finished my 
  MVP,(Before I lost the code). I felt kinda of proud with my code as I was juts finishing my second level which is a platformer level that works similar to the skyworld level in Mario games. Below is a small sample of my level 2.
````js
        loadSprite("grass", "/sprites/grass.png")

        const leve2l = addlevel([
	"        =  =   ^ ^  =        ==^==           ^   ",
	"=  =  =      = = ^   =    =              ="        ,
   "                 ==        =            =          =",
], {
	tileWidth: 86,
	tileHeight: 124,

THis project gave me a well developed, I could learn more about [kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/).

## My progress towards my MVP

   Ah yes, my [MVP](https://github.com/fatjond0413/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/index.html), I had completed it, however I decided to do something very stupid, this stupid thing had lead me to lossing my entire code, my entire MVP. THe mistake was that instead of puting my MVP code into
