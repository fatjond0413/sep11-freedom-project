  ## Learning about my tool
   After a couple of months of working with kaboom and completeing my freedom project on Kaboom.js(A very bad move I know I will talk about later) I had finished finished my 
  MVP(Before I lost the code). I felt kinda of prond with my code as I was juts finishing my second level being an obby level that looks like the code below.
````js
        loadSprite("grass", "/sprites/grass.png")

        const leve2l = addlevel([
	"        =  =   ^ ^  =    = ",
	"=  =  =      = = ^   =",
   "                 ==        =",
], {
	
	tileWidth: 64,
	tileHeight: 164,
