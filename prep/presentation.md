# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* For my hook I plan to start with question. The question I am thinking of is ¨I know all of you have played ¨

## Product
* I first plan to give a short and brief explanation, with my max goal of sentences per slide would be 5 and I plan to give my product 4 slides,of my product,that it is and 3 to 4 level RPG(IF you find the secret level).After that I will explain what the controls are, certian mobs. I will also show 2  code snippits, the first being of the bosses to show how they opperate, while the second being how the map of the second level was made. AS for the formation of my slides, .The second will be me either puting a link to my freedom project so that I can play it while presenting, there will also be a link to my entire freedom project code. My third slide be some code snippets about

## Process
* I will first explain the 

## Conclusion
* 

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
